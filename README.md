# Next.js 15 Image Optimization and Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15 related to image optimization and error handling when dealing with broken or invalid image paths.  The `pages/about.js` file includes an image tag with a path to a non-existent image. This causes an error, potentially crashing the page or causing unexpected behavior.

The solution in `pages/aboutSolution.js` demonstrates how to handle this situation gracefully, preventing the error from impacting the entire page.
